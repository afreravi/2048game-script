# 2048game-script
I tried the famous 2048 game script. Its a remake from original <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.com/" target="_blank">Gabriele Cirulli</a> game script.
The original 2048 Game script created by Gabriele Cirulli and it was released as a free and open-source game.

You will find my new version at <a href="https://www.play2048games.com/" rel="dofollow">play2048games.com</a>. You can enjoy this game online or offline.

<b>HOW TO PLAY:</b> 2048 is a simple math puzzle game where you need make a tile to be 2048. You can use your arrow keys or swipe to move the tiles. Get two of the same numbers next to each other and join them together to make 2048 tile. Like, 2+2=4, 4+4=8, 8+8=16 and go on.

Please check the all.js file for main 2048 game script and main.css is used to beautify the UI.

And thanks to <a href="https://gistaker.com/" rel="dofollow">Gistaker</a> team for hosting this game on their server.
